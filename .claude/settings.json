## 3. Paste this as your first Claude Code prompt
```
@CLAUDE.md @index.html @assets/shared.css @assets/main.js

You are acting as a senior front-end engineer and UX systems thinker 
working on my personal portfolio. Read CLAUDE.md first — it is the 
single source of truth for this project.

Here is the current repo state and what I need you to do:

CONTEXT:
- All 18 files are already in this repo (index.html, about.html, 
  resume.html, contact.html, 9 project pages, shared.css, main.js, 
  Federico_Monroy_CV.pdf, ASSETS_PLAN.md, README.md)
- Stack: pure HTML + CSS + vanilla JS, no build step
- Design system lives entirely in assets/shared.css
- Nav behavior lives in assets/main.js

YOUR FIRST TASK — Audit & Fix Pass:
Run through this checklist on every HTML file:

1. CONSISTENCY: Confirm nav markup is identical across all 13 pages 
   (same dropdown groups, same IDs, same ARIA attributes)

2. PATHS: Project pages use ../assets/ and ../index.html — 
   root pages use assets/ and index.html — verify no broken paths

3. ACCESSIBILITY:
   - Every page has skip-link as first child of <body>
   - Every <img> has alt text
   - Nav has aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, role="menu", role="menuitem"
   - No font-weight: 300 in shared.css or any inline style

4. ACCENT SYSTEM: Every project page has a <style> block in <head> 
   setting --accent, --accent-dim, --project-glow to its assigned color

5. PDF: resume.html embeds assets/Federico_Monroy_CV.pdf via <object>
   with a fallback download link

After the audit, report what you fixed and what still needs real 
content (images, case study text). Then ask me what to work on next.
